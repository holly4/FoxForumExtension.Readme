### Note: 

I realized how annoying this update page can be when my extension was upgraded and this page popped up while I was watching a movie. In a future release I will change
the upgrade notice to occur then the extension is first used after an upgrade.

### Overview
The Fox Forum Helper extension acts only on pages on FoxNews.com. For any other pages it is not loaded at all by Chrome. On Fox News pages with comment forums it activates and provides these features:

- Cleaning the page - removes all but the forum content from the article page.
- Show Liker Avatars - display of the avatars of users who liked a comment.
- Disable Scrolling - disables the scrolling when someone replies to your comment
- Cleaning Comments - remove extra blank lines and over use of bold and uppercase from comments.
- Showing Filtered Comments - show comments filtered by Fox News including when your own comments are filtered.

### Changes for Version 2.3.1  BETA (4/26/2017)
2.3.1  BETA (4/26/2017)
The only change in version 2.3.1 is to retain the page masthead when cleaning the page. To retain the prior appearance an option to remove the masthead is available under advanced options. See this [help topic](http://hollies.pw/static/ffh/2.3.1/help/index.html?RemovingtheMasthead.html) for further information.
