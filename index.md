### Note: 

I realized how annoying this update page can be when my extension was upgraded and this page popped up while I was watching a movie. In a future release I will change
this upgrade notice to occur when the extension is first used after an upgrade.

### Overview
The Fox Forum Helper extension acts only on pages on FoxNews.com. For any other pages it is not loaded at all by Chrome. On Fox News pages with comment forums it activates and provides these features:

- Cleaning the page - removes all but the forum content from the article page.
- Show Liker Avatars - display of the avatars of users who liked a comment.
- Disable Scrolling - disables the scrolling when someone replies to your comment
- Cleaning Comments - remove extra blank lines and over use of bold and uppercase from comments.
- Showing Filtered Comments - show comments filtered by Fox News including when your own comments are filtered.

### Changes for Version 2.3.2 (5/6/2017)
Incorporate changes made in the two beta releases since the last production release. The major ones:
- Add the Custom Link field to Fox News Page. See 
[custom link](http://hollies.pw/static/ffh/2.3.2/help/index.html?CustomLink.html) on how to configure this link.
- Retain the Fox News masthead section at the top of the page. See [removing the masthead](http://hollies.pw/static/ffh/2.3.2/help/index.html?RemovingtheMasthead.html) if you prefer the prior appearance.

For further details on other changes see the [release notes](http://hollies.pw/static/ffh/2.3.2/help/index.html?ReleaseNotes.html).
