### Overview
The Fox Forum Helper Beta extension is a separate extension from the Fox Forum Helper. The intent is to roll out features to interested users and test them before incorporation into the release version extension.
See recent posts on [hollies.pw](http://hollies.pw).

### Changes for Version 2.4.3 BETA (9/17/2017)
This version gets closer to the actual release. The remaining issues are updating the options page and popup page and making the avatar swaps editable by the user.
- Add options to hide top and reply activity bars.
- Format option table better and allow to minimize entire table
- Add user Thinkinowtloud2 to stock avatar swap table.
