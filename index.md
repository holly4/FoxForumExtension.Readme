### Overview
The Fox Forum Helper Beta extension is a seperate extension from the Fox Forum Helper. The intent is to roll out features to interested users and test them before incorporation into the release version extension.
To understand what is in the Beta extension [please read this blog post](http://hollies.pw/2017/09/12/fox-forum-helper-version-2-4-1-beta-released/).

### Changes for Version 2.4.2 BETA (9/12/2017)
This version redoes the settings access code which was unreliable in the last version. The change in settings will make any prior
settings stored by the user unseen.
It also adds automatic selection of "Newest" posts to view in the forum which has apparently been changed to "Best" by Fox News.
- Rewrite settings access code and use chrome.local instead of chome.sync storage.
- Add deplorable troll WhereAreAnyGoodOnes as the only user filtered by default.
- Set choice of post types to see as "Newest" and not "Best" on page load.

### More Information/Support/Questions
- There is no online help yet for the new version to support Fox News' new forum software.
