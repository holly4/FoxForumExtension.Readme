### Note: 

I realized how annoying this update page can be when my extension was upgraded and this page popped up while I was watching a movie. In a future release I will change
this upgrade notice to occur when the extension is first used after an upgrade.

### Overview
The Fox Forum Helper extension acts only on pages on FoxNews.com. For any other pages it is not loaded at all by Chrome. On Fox News pages with comment forums it activates and provides these features:

- Cleaning the page - removes all but the forum content from the article page.
- Show Liker Avatars - display of the avatars of users who liked a comment.
- Disable Scrolling - disables the scrolling when someone replies to your comment
- Cleaning Comments - remove extra blank lines and over use of bold and uppercase from comments.
- Showing Filtered Comments - show comments filtered by Fox News including when your own comments are filtered.

### Changes for Version 2.3.3 (5/11/2017)
Fox has a new article format for some articles that causes the clean page feature to remove all content from the page.
- Detect which of two article formats the article is in. Do not clean the page if a newer unknown format comes along
- Properly clean the page when this new format is detected
- For the newer format replace the 13 point font size in comments with a 17 point font size.
- Add link to online help under editor.

For further details on other changes see the [release notes](http://hollies.pw/static/ffh/2.3.3/help/index.html?ReleaseNotes.html).
