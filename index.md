### Overview
The Fox Forum Helper extension acts only on pages on FoxNews.com. For any other pages it is not loaded at all by Chrome. On Fox News pages with comment forums it activates and provides these features:

- Cleaning the page - removes all but the forum content from the article page.
- Show Liker Avatars - display of the avatars of users who liked a comment.
- Disable Scrolling - disables the scrolling when someone replies to your comment
- Cleaning Comments - remove extra blank lines and over use of bold and uppercase from comments.
- Showing Filtered Comments - show comments filtered by Fox News including when your own comments are filtered.

### Changes for Version 2.4.0 (9/6/2017)
Fox has a new comment forum format. This release will work with the new format but only the "Clean Page" function to remove
all but the article (which is hidden) and remove all non-forum content. The new forum uses a different
technology than the present forum so further investigation will be needed on making other features
of the extension work with the new format.
- Detect which forum format and act appropriately
- Add link for FoxForums.info site

For further details on other changes see the [release notes](http://hollies.pw/static/ffh/2.3.3/help/index.html?ReleaseNotes.html).

### Note: 

I realized how annoying this update page can be when my extension was upgraded and this page popped up while I was watching a movie. In a future release I will change
this upgrade notice to occur when the extension is first used after an upgrade.
