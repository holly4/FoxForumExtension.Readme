### Overview
The Fox Forum Helper Beta extension is a separate extension from the Fox Forum Helper. The intent is to roll out features to interested users and test them before incorporation into the release version extension.
See recent posts on [hollies.pw](http://hollies.pw).

### Changes for Version 2.4.4 BETA (9/18/2017)
This release was necessitated by Fox News version changing the article page format. 
It contains a new feature that is only mostly done; a graph showing post activity over time.
This is something I had implemented in a never-released version I was working on when Fox News changed the forum format.
It shows how many posts have been added to the page per minute to give you an idea of how active the
forum is. Note, however, that in the new forum posts are only added to the page mostly when the "Show X posts" button is pressed.
Thus, you will get spikes in the graph as all those posts are read from the server and updated at the time you press the button.
- Recognize new article format and show and hide the article
- remove a new sidebar added to the right when cleaning the page
- change user name on the pink bunny avatar from KCH1 to KCH3
