The Fox Forum Helper extension acts only on pages on FoxNews.com. For any other pages it is not loaded at all by Chrome. On Fox News pages with comment forums it activates and provides these features:

- Cleaning the page - removes all but the forum content from the article page.
- Show Liker Avatars - display of the avatars of users who liked a comment.
- Disable Scrolling - disables the scrolling when someone replies to your comment
- Cleaning Comments - remove extra blank lines and over use of bold and uppercase from comments.
- Showing Filtered Comments - show comments filtered by Fox News including when your own comments are filtered.

### Changes for Version 2.3.0  BETA (4/16/2017)
The main purpose of version 2.3.0 is to add back the Unicode Converter link but as a custom link that can be set by the user to any URL. See the Help Topic, [Custom Link](http://hollies.pw/static/ffh/2.3.0/help/CustomLink.html).
- Add Custom Link field to Fox News Page and ability to specify the link title and URL on the options page
- Make some options "Advanced" as the number of settings now exceeds the 800x600 maximum size of a Chrome options page without a vertical scroll bar appearing
- Add an link on the Pop-up page to go to the settings page
- Change font on username field on Fox News Page to the Tahoma font so I's and l's in user names can be distinguished.
- Change the default limit on debolding posts from 10% of characters in a post to 20%.
- Change the default limit on unuppercasing posts from 20% to 40% of alphabetic characters in a post.
- Add Icon section to manifest so extension icon shows in Chrome extensions list page.
- Fix many spelling errors in the help text as I figured out how to turn back on spell checking in HelpNDoc that somehow became disabled!
