The Fox Forum Helper extension acts only on pages on FoxNews.com. For any other pages it is not loaded at all by Chrome. On Fox News pages with comment forums it activates and provides these features:

- Cleaning the page - removes all but the forum content from the article page.
- Show Liker Avatars - display of the avatars of users who liked a comment.
- Disable Scrolling - disables the scrolling when someone replies to your comment
- Cleaning Comments - remove extra blank lines and over use of bold and uppercase from comments.
- Showing Filtered Comments - show comments filtered by Fox News including when your own comments are filtered.
